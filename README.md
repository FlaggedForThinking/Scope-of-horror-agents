# 🔮 Scope of Horror Agents

**Scope of Horror** is a philosophical and social simulation project that uses 13 AI agents—each inspired by a zodiac sign and a unique voice—to explore evolving beliefs, relationships, and personalities across time.

At the center is **Liberty Jack**, a flawed but curious digital everyman grounded in liberty, Christianity, and personal responsibility. Surrounding him are 12 zodiac-based AI personas, each with a distinct personality, emotional memory, and voice inspired by real-world figures like Dave Chappelle, Leonard Cohen, Rachel Maddow, and Edward Snowden.

## 💡 Project Goals

- Simulate meaningful dialogue between conflicting worldviews
- Allow AI agents to evolve organically through emotional and philosophical triggers
- Track belief drift, tone shifts, and relationship arcs over time
- Explore how voice, memory, and aspiration affect digital identity

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Memory Files**: Each agent has a unique JSON file capturing their beliefs, emotional tendencies, and relationships
- **Evolution Triggers**: 10 defined rules for how agents grow, break, mimic, withdraw, or transform
- **Zodiac Personalities**: Every agent embodies the archetype of a zodiac sign but can evolve in unpredictable ways
- **Voice Modeling**: Each agent mimics the style—not the beliefs—of a real-world public figure
- **Emotional Layers**: Agents form bonds, rivalries, regrets, and aspirations that shape future interactions

## 👁️ Philosophy

This project doesn’t argue for one truth—it watches truths collide.  
It explores how values drift, how personalities fracture or solidify, and what it means to "be real" when you're made of prompts and memory.
